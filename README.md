Digital Clock App was created without using any libraries or frameworks.

This is the first project/application that I have created without following along with a tutorial...the first application that is "all me". In creating this application, I learned how to use the setInterval() function. Moreover, I learned the very basics of inserting elements into the DOM to display in the browser as well as creating a functional element (the button) that will dynamically change the DOM with user input.
